# Deploy

It was used the file named `kafka-and-ui.yaml` which contains a kafka server and a kafka server ui to administrate it. 



### Configuration

To configure the Kafka cluster in the web ui, it was used the following information:

- local IP host where the apache server was created
- default port used when installing kafka (9092)

[^Note]: localhost hostname doesn't work
